# MandelbrotGL
A small implementation of a Mandelbrot "explorer" using OpenGL. It uses a fragment shader to do the core of the calculations,
so the visualization is pretty close to real time (if not real time!). I did not come up with the color scheme, I could not
find one pleasing enough!

## Librairies used
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)
